# Project Overview

## Project Name

Princeify

## Project Description

Princeify allows the user to search for song lyrics and then "Princeifies" them with Prince's characteristic abbreviations such as "U," "üëÅÔ∏è," and "2."

## API and Data Sample

Princeify uses the Musixmatch API to pull up song lyrics (well, at least 30% of them - full lyrics are behind a paywall).

lyrics_body: "Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough No, you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number ... ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use ******* (1409618871795)", ```

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

- Find and use external api
- Render data on page
- Allow user to choose favorites

#### PostMVP

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Jan 2rd| Project Prompt | Incomplete
|Jan 3rd| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|Jan 5th| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Jan 6th| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Jan 7th| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Jan 8th| MVP | Incomplete
|Jan 9th| Present | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

## API Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
